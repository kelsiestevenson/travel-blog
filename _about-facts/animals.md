I have a Chihuahua/Italian Greyhound mix named Elia. She is quite a sassy pants but also the best snuggler. I would love to have a Corgi later in life. Growing up, my family had dogs, peacocks, cockatiels, and various critters from the forest (to name a few). To say I am an animal lover is an understatement.
